# Algorithms in Java

A place where I practice writing algorithms in Java.

## Big O

[Big-O Cheet Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) - This was useful to keep in mind the 
complexity of different sorting algorithms.  

## JDK

It's a fun exercise to look at the JDK code to see how they have implemented sorting. 

See `java.util.Arrays`
